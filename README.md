# Counter-Strike 1.6 RPC

## What is this about?

This is a simple Python script that shows information of Counter-Strike 1.6 in Discord Rich Presence, using either IP of the server or Steam WebAPI to get status of the server.

## How to use it?

First of all, you can [download from Releases](https://github.com/Drakunovu/csrpc/releases/latest), or you can clone this repository

If you clone/download this repository:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) must be **>= 3.6**

- Install the needed packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- And then you should be able to run: `python main.py`

## TO-DO

Here is a list of things that could make better this script:

- Make the script work on almost any Valve games (Half-Life-based ones, or even Source-based ones) with automatic recognition of the game

- ~~Multilingual support~~ ✅

- More variables to show (for example, PUGs Servers could show "T: 1 | CT: 5" in the details section)

- ~~Possible better code formatting and optimizations~~ ✅
